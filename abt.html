            If you’re like most other owners and operators of hospitality businesses, you have 12 hours of work to do and only 4 hours to do it. You’re buried under a mountain of staffing issues, vendor relations, private events, and Yelp reviews. And why is everything always breaking??

            With so much on your plate, you don’t have time to learn about using language to encourage loyal customers. Or article writing best practices for increased visibility. So  when you need website content or email marketing? You DIY it and hope for the best.
            
            Maybe it’s time to bring in a specialist instead.

            <b>Hospitality people are my people. So I decided to write for them as a full-time gig. And while I may hang my hat in beautiful Austin, Texas, I work with businesses all over the U.S. and internationally.

                If it involves eating, drinking, or having a good time, I’m your gal!</b>
